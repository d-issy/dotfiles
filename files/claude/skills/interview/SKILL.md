# Interview

## Purpose

Execute the `Workflow` and `Report` sections to clarify requirements.

## Instructions

Focus on these areas when asking questions:

- Scope: What exactly should be implemented? What is out of scope?
- Requirements: What are the specific behaviors or constraints?
- Existing patterns: Should it follow existing code patterns?
- Edge cases: How should edge cases be handled?
- Testing: Are tests required?

## Workflow

1. Analyze the user's instruction and identify all ambiguous points
2. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask targeted questions
   - Provide concrete options instead of open-ended questions
   - Place recommended option first with "(Recommended)"
3. Repeat step 2 as needed until the task is fully clarified

## Report

Summarize the clarified requirements before proceeding.
